Dear Chandra,
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on my recent activities:
Image Component Development:
I have successfully developed the Image Component, which includes three tabs:
ImageTabPanel: This panel contains 4 items, including a multifield and dropdown.
Advanced Tab: This tab includes 4 components.
Maximizer Tab: This tab features a single item with ID I.
Testing:
Today, I completed testing on the CardAggregator component. It performed well under various conditions, and I encountered no significant issues during testing.
Please let me know if you need any further details or if there are specific aspects you would like me to delve into.
