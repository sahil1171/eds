Story Overview: I have been assigned a story to create a CSV file for user reports for the access control team.

Backend Development: I have written a servlet to generate the CSV file, ensuring that the generated file is sorted alphabetically.

UI Implementation: I have developed JavaScript for handling expanded and grouped reports. When the "expanded" option is selected, it calls the AEM servlet to generate and download the user report CSV file. When "grouped" is selected, it downloads a regular report.

CSV Download Process: The JavaScript is designed to make sure the correct report (expanded or grouped) is downloaded based on the user's selection.

EBM Testing: In addition to this, I am testing EBM templates and pages by creating workflows.

Author-Publisher Validation: As part of the testing, I am verifying whether changes made in the author environment are successfully reflected in the publisher environment.
