I wanted to inform you that a story point was assigned to me on Tuesday to migrate from Classic UI to Touch UI, specifically for the Image component which includes multifield, links, and other features. I have developed it and completed the task successfully.

Starting Thursday, I have begun working on testing the components that Vinayak has migrated from Classic UI to Touch UI.
