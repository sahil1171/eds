Subject: Update on Completed Stories and Current Work Progress

Hi Chandrakant,

I wanted to provide an update on the work assigned to me:

On 24 September, I was assigned two stories:

A single video should be selected when the variation is being used in the video component.
S2 version upgrade from the current to the latest minor version on v2.4.
For the first story, I updated the cq-dialog with the required field and wrote a JS file for validations. The code was committed, merged, and has been released in the production environment.

For the second story, I updated the version.properties file to upgrade the version. The necessary changes were made, and the code has been committed and merged. It is now in QA. I successfully completed both stories before the deadline.

Additionally, on 8 October, I was assigned a new story related to Brightcove to VBrick video migration execution, which I am currently working on.
